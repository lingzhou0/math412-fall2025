## Course Overview

This course introduces **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** — a rapidly developing field at the intersection of topology, geometry, and data science.
We’ll explore mathematical foundations (simplicial complexes, homology, persistence), algorithms for computing topological summaries, and real-world applications in data analysis and machine learning.

Students will gain hands-on experience implementing TDA methods and apply them in a **final project** that may be theoretical, computational, or application-driven.

## Final Project

The final project is your opportunity to apply or explore Topological Data Analysis (TDA) in depth.
Possible directions include:

* **Applied:** Analyze a real or synthetic dataset using TDA methods
* **Theoretical:** Explore or extend an idea related to persistent homology
* **Survey:** Summarize and discuss recent research on a chosen TDA topic

Projects may be completed *individually or in groups of up to three*.
Group projects are expected to show greater scope or depth.
*Graduate students* should submit proportionally longer reports.

## Use of AI Tools

AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot) may be used for **idea generation, debugging, or background learning**, but:

* All work must reflect **your own understanding**.
* **Copying or lightly editing** AI-generated output is **NOT** allowed.
* You should be prepared to **explain** any submitted work.
* If AI tools were used, include a short **acknowledgment** explaining how they were used.
