# Topological Data Analysis — MATH412 / COMPSCI434 / MATH713 (Fall 2025)

Instructor: Ling Zhou  
Email: ling.zhou@duke.edu  
Office: Physics 208

Class: Tu/Th 3:05–4:20 PM, Gross Hall 318

Course focus
- Intro to Topological Data Analysis (theory + applications). Early emphasis on persistence diagrams and algorithms, later topics in algebraic topology, TDA+ML, and projects.

Core materials
- Textbook: Computational Topology for Data Analysis (Dey & Wang) — available online.  
- Course links: lecture notes and resources (see course pages used as references).

Grading (short)
- Homework: 10.5%  
- Final project: Proposal 10%, Report 39.5%, Presentation 40%  
(No exams)

Key policies (brief)
- AI tools may be used for brainstorming or debugging but not to produce submitted work verbatim — disclose AI assistance in final reports when applicable.  
- Collaborate on ideas; write-ups must be your own.  
- Late policy and extensions: small extension policy and penalties apply (see instructor for details).  
- Accommodations: contact SDAO and the instructor.

Project notes
- Projects may be individual or groups (up to 3). Proposal due mid-semester; final report + presentation at end of term. If code is submitted, include a GitHub repo and README with run instructions.

Repository layout (suggested)
- `lectures/` — slides and lecture notes  
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks (e.g., `homology_of_simplicial_complexes.ipynb`)  
- `assignments/` — homework submissions and templates  
- `projects/` — project code and data  
- `docs/` — syllabus, schedule, resources

Quick setup (suggested)
1. Create a Python venv and install common libs (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, gudhi or ripser).  
2. Launch Jupyter Lab / Notebook and open notebooks in `notebooks/`.

Contact / help
- Ask course questions on Ed discussion (Canvas). For direct email, use ling.zhou@duke.edu.

This README is intentionally short. This repository is intended for Python-related course materials only (code, notebooks, and project implementations). Other items (slides, full syllabus, handouts) are posted on Canvas.

If you'd like, I can create a `notebooks/` folder and move Python notebooks here, add a `projects/` folder, and include a `requirements.txt` for reproducibility.
