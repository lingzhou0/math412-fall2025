## Course Overview

This course introduces **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** — a rapidly developing field at the intersection of topology, geometry, and data science.
We’ll explore mathematical foundations (simplicial complexes, homology, persistence), algorithms for computing topological summaries, and real-world applications in data analysis and machine learning.

Students will gain hands-on experience implementing TDA methods and apply them in a **final project** that may be theoretical, computational, or application-driven.

## Final Project

A substantial research or application project applying TDA. Options include:

* Analyze a real or synthetic dataset using TDA methods
* Explore or extend theoretical aspects of persistent homology
* Survey recent research (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR papers)

Work individually or in groups of ≤3. Graduate students are expected to submit longer reports.
Templates are available on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bwdqbcxvdmtw).

* All submitted work must reflect **your own understanding**
* Copy-paste of AI output is not allowed
* Significant AI use must be **acknowledged** in your report
